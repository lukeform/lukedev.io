                Hello there!<br><br>

                My name is Luke. I have worked in tech for over 10 years in various different roles.<br>
                Beginning as a product owner I spent a lot of time thinking about how digital products should work and what they should do, and then handing over that vision to designers and developers.<br><br>
                
                I loved working with tech businesses to set them on their way, and spent a few years heading up a startup investment funnel, focusing on coaching founders and validating their ideas with the market.<br><br> 
                
                One thing always bothered me however, and that was handing over a vision, some plans and startups to other developers and hoping what came back in a few months and was right. <br><br>
                
                So, I decided to become a web developer myself. This is my page showcasing what I have built and what I have learnt. <br><br>
                
                I hope you enjoy!
